# jaChat
Just Another Chat application. Made with [Meteor](https://meteor.com) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html). If a new javascript framework is announced every week I think we can develop another chat application, can't we?

The purpose of this app is to teach myself React and how to integrate it with Meteor.

I am going to develop the application in an iterative way. I will improve it on each step adding new functionality that leads me to learn more and more of React. Anything you think that can be improved please tell me (best practices, naming, conventions, code, packages, ...).


## Roadmap
Each step has its corresponding branch.

### Step 0
Initial bootstrap. No login functionality, insecure package still active, no design, no tests.

You can add messages via browser console:

    Messages.insert({description: 'Right from the console'})

### Step 1
Add input text to add messages. Messages ordered by creation Date. Better presentation and styling.
